## Hi there 👋

This is the home of the LD Archive. You can find us on the web at [ld-archive.org](https://www.ld-archive.org). 
We are developing an archive of lighting designs for the performing arts.
A place where practicioners, researchers and students can view the work of other professionals. 
The aim is to preserve and share the work across the industry.

## Project Status
- 🌱 At the moment the project is just getting started. 
We are still building the website and exploring how it might work.
- 💡 We are hoping to launch the website in 2025, but no promises...
- ☕ Is going to be key to this project.

## What is the LD Archive?
The Lighting Design Archive is a place for lighting designers for performance to share their lighting plans. 
Maybe over time we will include a few pictures as well. 
We know that our artform is ephemeral and currently there isn't any central place for us to archive our plans.

### Why Archive?
Archiving is key to ensuring that future designers can learn about the history and development of the artform. 
Exposure for students, researchers and practicioners allows us to develop and grow as an artform. 

### Why Make Designs Accessible?
Archiving is only part of the process. We also want to make designs available to other practicioners. 
Continual professional developemnt is hard as a freelance creative, sharing is the only way to make this possible.

### Funding
We are currently exploring funding options. Have money? Get in touch!

### Help with Development
We are of course interested in help with website development. If you are interested in helping please say hello. Small and large support is welcomed.
